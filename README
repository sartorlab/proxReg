Reproducing analysis and figures in proxReg paper

After cloning the repository, code blocks should be immediately runnable except for those 
requiring larger download files. Blocks to generate figures only need the files in the 
repository but may require extra packages.

 For regenerating supplementary figure 1, the python code titled “sup.fig.1.py” is provided. 
 The input files for this script are: 1) ProxReg output files of all 90 Chip-Seq data, 
 2) GO term related information extracted from org.Hs.eg.db. Once these two datasets were prepared, 
 users can run the python script to generate the data for supplementary figure 1. 
 The file paths in the python script need to be changes, users can follow the 
 comments in the script to change related paths.
